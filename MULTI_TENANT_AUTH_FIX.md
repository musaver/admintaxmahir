# Multi-Tenant Authentication Fix for Production

## üö® Current Issue
Users are being redirected to login because authentication sessions aren't being recognized on tenant subdomains in production.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
The log shows: `"Redirecting unauthenticated tenant user to login"`

This happens because:
1. **Cookie Domain Issues**: NextAuth cookies aren't being shared correctly across subdomains
2. **NEXTAUTH_URL Configuration**: Needs to handle multiple subdomains
3. **Session Validation**: Middleware can't validate JWT tokens properly

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Cookie Configuration
- Ensured cookies work across subdomains
- Added proper security settings for production
- Set domain to `undefined` to allow per-subdomain cookies

### 2. Enhanced JWT Token Handling
- Improved token validation in middleware
- Better error handling for authentication failures

## üéØ Critical Vercel Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Vercel dashboard:

```env
# NextAuth Configuration (CRITICAL)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://hisaab360.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-here

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=your-production-db-host
DB_USER=your-production-db-user
DB_PASS=your-production-db-password
DB_NAME=your-production-db-name

# Multi-tenant Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN=hisaab360.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

## üîß Additional Fix: Dynamic NEXTAUTH_URL

For multi-tenant authentication to work properly, you might need to set the NEXTAUTH_URL dynamically. Add this to your Vercel environment variables:

```env
# If the above doesn't work, try setting NEXTAUTH_URL to the main domain
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://hisaab360.com

# Or alternatively, set it to handle subdomains dynamically
NEXTAUTH_URL_INTERNAL=https://hisaab360.com
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Update Environment Variables in Vercel**
2. **Deploy the updated code**
3. **Clear browser cookies** (important for testing)
4. **Test login on tenant subdomain**

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Clear All Cookies
- Open browser dev tools
- Go to Application/Storage tab
- Clear all cookies for `hisaab360.com` and subdomains

### Step 2: Test Login Flow
```
1. Visit: https://acme-electronics.hisaab360.com
2. Should redirect to: https://acme-electronics.hisaab360.com/login
3. Login with: admin@acme-electronics.com / admin123
4. Should redirect to: https://acme-electronics.hisaab360.com/dashboard
```

### Step 3: Verify Session Persistence
```
1. After successful login, refresh the page
2. Should NOT redirect to login
3. Should stay on dashboard with sidebar visible
```

## üîç Debug Steps

### Check Environment Variables
Visit: `https://hisaab360.com/api/debug/env`
Ensure all critical variables show "SET"

### Check Vercel Function Logs
```bash
vercel logs --follow
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ "Tenant found and active: [Tenant Name]"
- ‚ùå "Redirecting unauthenticated tenant user to login"

### Check Browser Network Tab
1. Open dev tools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Try to login
3. Look for failed requests to `/api/auth/*`
4. Check if cookies are being set properly

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Still Getting "Redirecting unauthenticated"
**Solution**: Check if NEXTAUTH_SECRET is properly set in Vercel

### Issue 2: Login Form Submits but Redirects Back to Login
**Solution**: Database connection issue - verify DB credentials

### Issue 3: Cookies Not Being Set
**Solution**: Clear all browser cookies and try again

### Issue 4: "Tenant not found" Errors
**Solution**: Ensure tenant data in `lib/tenant-edge.ts` matches your production tenants

## üìã Production Checklist

- [ ] NEXTAUTH_URL set to `https://hisaab360.com`
- [ ] NEXTAUTH_SECRET is strong and unique
- [ ] Database credentials are correct and tested
- [ ] All cookies cleared from browser
- [ ] Tenant slugs match in hardcoded data
- [ ] Vercel domains configured: `hisaab360.com` and `*.hisaab360.com`
- [ ] SSL certificates are active

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Visit tenant subdomain** ‚Üí Redirects to tenant login
2. **Submit login form** ‚Üí Authenticates successfully  
3. **Redirects to dashboard** ‚Üí Shows admin panel with sidebar
4. **Refresh page** ‚Üí Stays authenticated (no redirect to login)
5. **API calls work** ‚Üí No more "unauthenticated" redirects

## üöÄ If Issues Persist

Try this alternative approach - set NEXTAUTH_URL to the specific tenant domain:

```env
# In Vercel, you might need to set:
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://acme-electronics.hisaab360.com
```

Or create a custom NextAuth configuration that handles multiple domains dynamically.

The key is ensuring that NextAuth cookies are properly set and validated across your tenant subdomains.
