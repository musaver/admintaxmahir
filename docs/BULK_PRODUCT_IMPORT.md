## Database Schema

### Import Jobs Table
The existing `import_jobs` table supports product imports with `type = 'products'`.

### Products Table
Products are created with:
- Automatic tenant ID injection
- Generated UUID for product ID
- Slug generation with timestamp for uniqueness
- Default values for optional fields

### Product Inventory Table
Inventory records created when stock quantity > 0:
- Links to product via `productId`
- Includes tenant ID for isolation
- Sets available quantity equal to initial stock

### Stock Movements Table
Audit trail for all stock changes:
- `movementType = 'in'` for initial stock
- `reason` from CSV Status column or "Initial Stock"
- `reference = 'BULK-IMPORT'`
- `processedBy = 'system'`

## Performance Considerations

- **Chunked Processing**: 25 products per chunk prevents timeout issues
- **Concurrent Limits**: Maximum 5 concurrent product import jobs
- **Memory Management**: Streams large files through Vercel Blob
- **Database Optimization**: Batch inserts within chunks
- **Progress Updates**: Efficient polling with 2-second intervals

## Error Recovery

- **Job Failure**: Failed jobs are marked in database with error details
- **Partial Success**: Successfully processed products remain in system
- **Retry Logic**: Users can restart failed imports with corrected data
- **Data Integrity**: All operations are transactional within chunks

## Monitoring

- **Job Status Tracking**: All jobs logged with timestamps
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error details for debugging
- **Progress Metrics**: Real-time progress and performance data
- **Tenant Isolation**: All logs include tenant context

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support for product images via URLs
- [ ] Weight-based product support
- [ ] Product variant bulk import
- [ ] Category and supplier auto-creation
- [ ] Excel file support
- [ ] Bulk update functionality
- [ ] Import scheduling
- [ ] Email notifications on completion

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETED

**Date Completed:** December 2024

The product bulk import feature has been successfully implemented with full compatibility to your existing add product form and add stock movement form. All field mappings, validation rules, and stock movement reasons match exactly with your current system.

### Key Achievements:
- **27 CSV columns supported** (matching all add product form fields)
- **Exact field mapping** with add product page
- **Stock movement validation** using predefined reasons from add stock movement page
- **Full tenant isolation** and multi-tenant support
- **Comprehensive error handling** with row-level reporting
- **Real-time progress tracking** with 2-second polling
- **Production-ready** with successful build verification

### Ready for Production Use:
- Navigate to Products → "Bulk Import"
- Download comprehensive CSV template
- Import products with stock information
- Monitor real-time progress
- View detailed success/error reports

### Latest Updates:
- **Fixed Next.js 15 compatibility**: Updated dynamic API routes to properly await `params` as required by Next.js 15
- **Enhanced import status routes**: Both `/api/products/import-status/[jobId]` and `/api/users/import-status/[jobId]` now include:
  - Proper tenant filtering for multi-tenant security
  - Type filtering ('products' vs 'users') to prevent cross-contamination
  - Consistent error handling with `ErrorResponses.invalidInput`
  - Improved progress calculation and time estimation
- **Security improvements**: All import status endpoints now require and validate tenant context
- **Build verification**: All routes compile successfully and are production-ready
